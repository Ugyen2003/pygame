Pyame unit test

unittest: Python's built-in testing framework used to create test cases and suites.
pygame: A library for creating games and multimedia applications in Python.
MagicMock from unittest.mock: A mock object used to simulate various aspects of the pygame module for testing purposes.
start_game Function
This function takes in a mode parameter ('normal', 'demo', or any other value). It sets a global variable show_start_screen based on the provided mode.
If the mode is 'normal', show_start_screen is set to False. If the mode is 'demo', show_start_screen is set to True. Otherwise, it defaults to False.
Test Classes
TestPygame and TestStartGame are two test classes inheriting from unittest.TestCase.
TestPygame contains a setup method setUp() where Pygame is initialized by setting up a window.
TestStartGame contains various test methods:
tearDown() method to quit Pygame after each test.
test_start_game_normal_mode: Checks if start_game('normal') sets show_start_screen to False.
test_start_game: Calls start_game(3), but there's no assertion made. This may need an assertion to check an expected outcome.
test_start_game_demo_mode: Checks if start_game('demo') sets show_start_screen to True.
test_handle_mouse_clicks: Initializes a cells list and defines a function handle_mouse_clicks, but this function is not defined or tested within this code snippet.
test_start_game_default_mode: Checks if start_game('unknown') sets show_start_screen to False. Additionally, it simulates a mouse click event but doesn't call the handle_mouse_clicks function.
Global Variables
At the end of the code, there are global variable declarations (cells, cell_width, cell_height, show_start_screen) set to None or default values.
if __name__ == '__main__':
This conditional block seems to be initializing some global variables related to the game.
Running the Tests
unittest.main() is called to run the tests defined in the test classes.
Issues/Improvements
test_start_game(3) doesn't contain an assertion, so it's unclear what it's testing.
handle_mouse_clicks function is mentioned but not defined or tested.
There seems to be a mix of testing start_game function and handling mouse clicks, but the click handling functionality isn't fully present in this code.
